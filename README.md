Large acoustic models

# Things to investigate
- alternatives to K-means and better tokenization
- long context to discover repeated impulses
- adding an <UNK> token 
- Try a denoising autoencoder in place of kmeans to create labels.
- Data augmentation by using sets of spectrogram parameters (vary SR +- 10%)
